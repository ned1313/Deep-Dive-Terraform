## Make sure consul is still running, if not open a separate terminal
## Go into m4\consul and fire it back up by running 
consul agent -bootstrap -config-file="config/consul-config.hcl" -bind="127.0.0.1"

## If you don't already have the development networking environment deployed
## let's do that know

# Let's set the Consul token to Mary Moe
# Replace SECRETID_VALUE with Mary Moe's secret ID
# Linux and MacOS
export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=SECRETID_VALUE

# Windows
$env:CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="SECRETID_VALUE"

# Initialize the backend
terraform init -backend-config="path=networking/state/globo-primary"

# Select the workspace
terraform workspace select development

# Create and apply the configuration
terraform plan -out dev.tfplan

terraform apply "dev.tfplan"

## Now let's use Sally Sue's token for Consul
## You can go into the ACL section of the Consul UI and grab it

# Linux and MacOS
export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=SECRETID_VALUE

# Windows
$env:CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="SECRETID_VALUE"

## We are going to deploy the development application environment
## If you already have it deployed, you can run destroy to remove it

## Go into the applications directory
cd ../applications

# Initialize the backend
terraform init -backend-config="path=applications/state/globo-primary"

# Select the workspace
terraform workspace select development

# Create and apply the configuration
terraform plan -out dev.tfplan

terraform apply "dev.tfplan"
